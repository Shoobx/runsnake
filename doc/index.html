  <h1>RunSnakeRun<br>
  </h1>
  <p class="introduction"><img style="width: 64px; height: 64px;" alt="RunSnakeRun" src="pyaccellerate-64.png" align="right">RunSnakeRun is a small
    GUI utility that allows you to view (Python) cProfile or Profile profiler dumps in a sortable GUI view. &nbsp;It allows
    you to explore the profiler information using a "square map" visualization or sortable tables of data.&nbsp; It also
    (experimentally) allows you to view the output of the Meliae "memory analysis" tool using the same basic visualisations.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>RunSnakeRun is a simple program, it doesn't provide all the bells-and-whistles of a program like KCacheGrind, it's intended
    to allow for profiling your Python programs, and just your Python programs. &nbsp;What it does provide, for profile viewing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>sortable data-grid views for raw profile information</li>
    <ul>
      <li>identity: function name, file-name, directory name</li>
      <li>time-spent: cumulative, cumulative-per, local and local-per time</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>overall data-grid view</li>
      <li>(all) callers-of-this-function, (all) callees-of-this-function views</li>
    </ul>
    <li>squaremap view of call tree</li>
    <ul>
      <li>size proportional to amount of time spent by the given parent in the given function</li>
    </ul>
    <li>squaremap view of packages/modules/functions</li>
    <ul>
      <li>size proportional to time spent in each package/module/function</li>
    </ul>
    <li>basic navigation (home, back, up)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For <a href="https://launchpad.net/meliae">Meliae</a> memory-dump viewing, it provides:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>sortable data-grid views</li>
    <li>squaremap of memory-usage</li>
    <li>basic navigation<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="install"></a>Installation<br>
  </h2>
  <p>You will need to have all of wxPython, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SquareMap/">SquareMap</a> and <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RunSnakeRun">RunSnakeRun</a>    installed to use RunSnakeRun. &nbsp;You may also need the "python-profiler" package for your platform, which provides
    the pstats view.&nbsp; You will likely want to use your platform wxPython package (i.e. a pre-built binary). For Debian/Ubuntu
    distributions the prerequisite setup looks like this:
  </p>
  <pre>apt-get install python-profiler python-wxgtk2.8 python-setuptools</pre>

  <p>RunSnakeRun and SquareMap will install well in a VirtualEnv if you would like to keep them isolated (normally you do not
    want to use the <code>--no-site-packages</code> flag if you are doing this).&nbsp; I recommend this approach rather than
    using easy_install directly on your Linux/OS-X host.<br>
  </p>
  <pre>virtualenv runsnake<br>source runsnake/bin/activate<br></pre>
  <p>If you already have Python setuptools installed (a.k.a. <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">easy_install</a>),
    you should be able to install the Python packages with:</p>

  <pre>easy_install SquareMap RunSnakeRun<br></pre>
  <p>You will require a modern <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython (e.g. 2.8)</a> and Python 2.x (e.g. 2.5 through 2.7)
    installation. &nbsp;The setup will create a script named "runsnake" on Linux machines which launches the profile viewer.&nbsp;
    On OS-X machines a wrapper script runsnake is created that runs the runsnake32 executable with a flag to tell Python
    to use the 32-bit implementation (for wxPython compatibility).&nbsp; On Win32 machines, a Scripts\runsnake.exe executable
    is created.&nbsp; If you have added your scripts directory to the PATH then this will be available from the command-line.

  </ul>



  <h3>cProfile Viewing<br>
  </h3>
  <p>To use cProfile to capture your application's profile data, either using the command-line, like so:</p>
  <pre>$ python -m cProfile -o &lt;outputfilename&gt; &lt;script-name&gt; &lt;options&gt;<br></pre>
  <p>Or in code, like so:<br>
  </p>

  <pre>import cProfile<br>command = """reactor.run()"""<br>cProfile.runctx( command, globals(), locals(), filename="OpenGLContext.profile" )</pre>
  <p>To view the results of your run:<br>
  </p>
  <pre>python runsnake.py OpenGLContext.profile<br></pre>
  <p>There will be a brief delay as the application is created and begins the loading process, then you should see something
    like this:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 1113px; height: 872px;" alt="Screenshot of the application viewing a HotShot profile" src="screenshot-2.0.png"><br>
  </p>
  <p>Click on any column title to sort by that property within that list. &nbsp;Select a record in the left-most list view to
    see a breakdown of that record in the right-side list views. &nbsp;Choose the appropriate view on the right via the tabs.
    &nbsp;You can resize the borders between the lists and square-map views. &nbsp;You can select a package/module/function
    hierarchic view via the menus. &nbsp;You can also toggle use of percentage displays there.</p>
  <h3>Meliae Memory Analysis</h3>
  <p><span class="technical"></span>Note: this feature is considered experimental, the memory consumed loading even a tiny meliae
    dump is enormous, so real-world programs will make RunSnakeRun quite slow and require a very large amount of RAM (far
    more than the process being viewed).
    <br>
    <span class="technical"></span></p>
  <p>To install<a href="https://launchpad.net/meliae"> Meliae</a>, you will need a working C extension compilation environment
    (Meliae uses a Cython extension):</p>
  <pre>easy_install meliae<br></pre>
  <p>Now instrument your application to be able to trigger a memory dump at the moment you would like to capture, like so:</p>
  <pre>from meliae import scanner<br>scanner.dump_all_objects( filename ) # you can pass a file-handle if you prefer<br></pre>
  <p>The memory dump will generally be quite large (e.g. 2MB to describe an application with 200KB of user-controllable memory
    usage (i.e. not the interpreter itself)) and for any real application will take an extremely long time to load (multiple
    minutes for 16MB dumps).</p>
  <pre>$ runsnakemem &lt;filename&gt;<br></pre>


  <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 1920px; height: 1159px;" alt="Screenshot of a meliae memory view" src="meliae-sample.png"></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">The Meliae loader in RunSnakeRun performs the following simplifications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>only displays memory which is reachable from a module (there is normally &gt; 1MB of unreachable objects included in
      a meliae dump)<br>
    </li>
    <li>treats modules as memory-cost barriers, so referencing a module does not cost the referrer anything</li>
    <li>treats all (reachable) references to an instance as sharing the cost of the instance equally</li>
    <li>treats loops as being a separate object which holds all objects in the loop, breaking inter-loop references but retaining
      child references, all references to the loop members become references to the loop
    </li>
    <li>eliminates dictionary objects from modules (always) and from types and classes when the dictionary is only referenced
      by the class/type, the cost of the dictionary is folded into the cost of the parent object (note: this means that function
      __globals__ references are "0-cost" and do not create loops)</li>
    <li>compresses large numbers (&gt;=10 currently) of "simple" objects of the same type held by a single parent into a "&lt;many&gt;"
      object with the type as the name</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even with those simplifications, however, the program is tracking most ints, strings, tuples, lists, etc. separately, which
    uses a large amount of RAM and slows down the GUI substantially.<br>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="code"></a>Code Access and Contributions</h2>
  <p>RunSnakeRun is reasonably stable. &nbsp;I don't tend to do much work on it, as it tends to just work. &nbsp;My (personal)
    current wish list for the project follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Speed up and reduce memory requirements for meliae loading</li>
    <li>Clean up the meliae loader (was grown organically from a quick hack and doesn't particularly invite further hacking)<br>
    </li>

  </ul>
  <p>If you have an idea, feel free to check out the code and&nbsp;implement the new&nbsp;feature. &nbsp;I'm certainly willing
    to entertain new features or bug-fix requests as well. &nbsp;The code is available in bzr here:</p>
  <pre>bzr branch lp:~mcfletch/squaremap/trunk squaremap<br>cd squaremap<br>python setup.py develop<br>bzr branch lp:~mcfletch/profile_viewer/trunk profile_viewer<br>cd profile_viewer<br>python setup.py develop<br></pre>
  <p>You can <a href="mailto:mcfletch@vrplumber.com">contact me directly</a> if you'd like to contribute. &nbsp;Or you can just
    set up a bzr branch on LaunchPad and request a merge.</p>
  <h2><a name="roadmap"></a>Roadmap/Wish-list</h2>
  <p>This is just a listing of things that either I or others have requested as features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>provide comparison views and "progress" views that compare across multiple profiles</li>
    <li>(re)support&nbsp;Hotshot profile dumps (removed because Hotshot itself was deprecated)</li>
    <li>support&nbsp;Robert Kern's line_profiler module (line and import timings)</li>
    <li>support&nbsp;IronPython profiles (with cleanup on load to remove "noise" functions)</li>
    <li>with a line-profiling module, allow per-line profile views</li>
    <li>support&nbsp;(C)&nbsp;calltree/cachegrind files (as used by kcachegrind)</li>
    <li>clean up the UI code (very hacky)</li>
    <li>configuration/storage of preferences such as column widths, rounded corners, padding, etc.</li>
    <li>utility functions for capturing data</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="othertools"></a>Other Tools</h2>
  <p>RunSnakeRun is by no means a comprehensive tool-set for profiling, you may want to have any or all of these other tools
    available for your profiling needs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot">Gprof2Dot</a> -- Converts various Profile formats into dot-format
