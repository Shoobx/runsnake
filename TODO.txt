Pending issues:

 * chooses wrong root when looking at CherryPy log files, should always have root that includes all others
 * needs better display of node-name for square-map
 * re-enable HotSpot support?
 * provide a lsprofcall import module
 * show directory/module nodes in left-most view when in directory mode
 * better handling of 0-value nodes
